This is an emulator of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum computer running on Murmulator RP2040 SoC powered boards.

Currently, it can be used with Raspberry Pico Pi (2) board, installed on ZX Murmulator board (VGA versions).

Just connect a VGA monitor or CRT TV (with special VGA-RGB cable needed), a PS/2 keyboard, prepare a SD Card as needed and power via microUSB.

This project is based on David Crespo excellent work on [ZX-ESPectrum-Wiimote](https://github.com/dcrespo3d/ZX-ESPectrum-Wiimote) which is a fork of the [ZX-ESPectrum](https://github.com/rampa069/ZX-ESPectrum) project by Rampa and Queru which was inspired by Pete's Todd [PaseVGA](https://github.com/retrogubbins/paseVGA) project.

## Features

- ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K and Pentagon 128K 100% cycle accurate emulation (no PSRAM needed).

## Work in progress

- +2A/+3 models.
- DSK support.

## Installing

You can flash the binaries directly to the board if do not want to mess with code and compilers. Check the [releases section](https://github.com/EremusOne/ZX-ESPectrum-IDF/releases)

## Compiling and installing

Quick start from PlatformIO:
- Clone this repo and Open from VSCode/PlatFormIO
- Execute task: Upload
- Enjoy

Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS/X. This version has been developed using PlatformIO.

#### Install platformIO:

- There is an extension for Atom and VSCode, please check [this website](https://platformio.org/).
- Select your board, pico32 which behaves just like the TTGo VGA32.

#### Compile and flash it

`PlatformIO > Project Tasks > Build `, then

`PlatformIO > Project Tasks > Upload`.

Run these tasks (`Upload` also does a `Build`) whenever you make any change in the code.

#### Prepare micro SD Card

The SD card should be formatted in FAT16 / FAT32.

Just that: then put your .sna, .z80, .p, .tap, .trd and .scl whenever you like and create and use folders as you need.

There's also no need to sort files using external utilities: the emulator creates and updates indexes to sort files in folders by itself.

## How to flash custom ROMs

Two custom ROMs can be installed: one for the 48K architecture and another for the 128K architecture.

The "Update firmware" option is now changed to the "Update" menu with three options: firmware, custom ROM 48K, and custom ROM 128K.

Just like updating the firmware requires a file named "firmware.bin" in the root directory of the SD card, for the emulator to install the custom ROMs, the files must be placed in the mentioned root directory and named as "48custom.rom" and "128custom.rom" respectively.

For the 48K architecture, the ROM file size must be 16384 bytes.

For the 128K architecture, it can be either 16kb or 32kb. If it's 16kb, the second bank of the custom ROM will be flashed with the second bank of the standard Sinclair 128K ROM.

It is important to note that for custom ROMs, fast loading of taps can be used, but the loading should be started manually, considering the possibility that the "traps" of the ROM loading routine might not work depending on the flashed ROM. For example, with Rodolfo Guerra's ROMs, both loading and recording traps using the SAVE command work perfectly.

Finally, keep in mind that when updating the firmware, you will need to re-flash the custom ROMs afterward, so I recommend leaving the files "48custom.rom" and "128custom.rom" on the card for the custom ROMs you wish to use.

## Hardware configuration and pinout

Pin assignment in `hardpins.h` is set to match the boards we've tested emulator in, use it as-is, or change it to your own preference.
